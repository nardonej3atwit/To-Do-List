Simple app to help learn C#

I used chat gpt to guide me in what gui to use and learn the syntax of it.

~ I think Winforms is good for really small programs like the one I just made. But, I can't see how it would be used effectively in larger programs and for that reason I probably won't be using it moving fowards.
Even if I continue to practice C# by creating programs like this one learning the sytax of a gui like Winforms won't be beneficial due to its limited use cases.
